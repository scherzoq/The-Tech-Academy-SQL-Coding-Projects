# The Tech-Academy SQL Coding Project: Library Management System
In this SQL coding project – the final project in the "Database and SQL" course I completed as a part of The Tech Academy's C# and .NET Boot Camp – I created a complete library management system relational database for multiple library branches. Various tables were used to represent data for different branches, books, borrowers, book loans, and more.

I also created different stored procedures to query for data based on a variety of specific criteria: data about books due today loaned out from a specific branch, data about borrowers with more than 5 books checked out, data about multiple copies of books owned by each branch, and more.
